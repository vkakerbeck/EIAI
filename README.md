# EIAI
Embodied Interacting Artificial Intelligence

*(In German pronounced 'AI')*

Investigation of learning through mostly self-supervised interaction with objects in 3D environments using body sensors and movements.

## Exploring Arm
Using the REALRobots KuKa arm environment (https://github.com/AIcrowd/real_robots/). The challenge is to learn in an intrinsic phase about properties of the environment without task or extrinsic rewards. Then a short extrinsic phase follows with goals being provided. The goals tell the robot where different objects should be placed on a table and on a shelf. The agent only has a very short time (10.000 steps) to adapt to this new goal oriented task.
